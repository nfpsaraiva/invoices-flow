# Implementation Plan

# InvoiceFlow

### **Description**

InvoiceFlow is a web application designed to streamline the management of service providers and their corresponding payments within an organization. The platform ensures a structured workflow for handling invoices, allowing project managers, finance teams, and providers to collaborate efficiently.

### **Objective**

The primary goal of InvoiceFlow is to simplify and centralize the invoice submission, approval, and validation process, reducing manual efforts and ensuring seamless communication between all stakeholders.

### **User Roles & Responsibilities**

**Project Managers Officer (PMO)**

*   Manages Project Managers, Providers, and Finance Managers.
*   Creates and oversees invoices.
*   Receives email notifications about invoice updates.

**Project Manager (PM)**

*   Collaborates with providers on invoices.
*   Receives notifications regarding invoice updates

**Provider (Service Supplier)**

*   Uploads invoice files for projects they were involved in
*   Receives notifications on invoice status

**Finance Manager (FM)**

*   Validates invoices upon successful payment
*   Receives notifications regarding invoice submissions and approvals

  

### **Core Features**

*   **User Management**: Role-based access with predefined permissions
*   **Invoice Management**: Creation, uploading, tracking, filtering, exporting and validation of invoices
*   **Email Notifications**: Automated email alerts for status updates
*   **Access Control**: Login-only access without a public registration option
*   **Predefined Admin Structure**: Super Admin manages initial user onboarding

### **Authentication & User Management**

*   **Restricted Access**: The platform does not allow public registration. User accounts are created and managed by the **Super Admin** or **Project Managers Officer (PMO)**.
*   **Role-Based Permissions**: Each user is assigned a predefined role (PMO, PM, Provider, Finance Manager), which determines their access rights.

### **Access Control & Data Protection**

**Data Encryption**: All sensitive data, including invoice files and user information, is encrypted both in transit (TLS/SSL) and at rest.

**Session Management**: Automatic session expiration and secure authentication tokens prevent unauthorized access.

  

*   **PMO**: Full control over project managers, providers, and invoices
*   **PM**: Limited access to assigned projects and invoices
*   **Provider**: Can only upload invoices and view their own records
*   **Finance Manager**: Can only review and validate invoices

### **Notification & Audit Logs**

**Email Notifications**: Users receive notifications for key actions, ensuring real-time awareness of invoice updates

**Audit Logs**: All critical actions (invoice creation, validation, user management) are logged to track changes and ensure accountability

### **System Architecture & Tech Stack**

The platform uses a **serverless architecture**, ensuring scalability, security, and cost efficiency. The platform leverages **Vercel** for frontend hosting and **Supabase** for backend services, including database management, authentication, storage, and business logic execution.

  

**System architecture**

The system follows a **fully serverless approach**, eliminating the need for traditional backend infrastructure while maintaining high availability and performance.

*   **Frontend:** A modern **React** application built with **Vite** and styled using **Tailwind CSS**, hosted on **Vercel** for fast, serverless deployment.
*   **Backend:** Supabase provides backend functionalities, replacing traditional backend servers with **Edge Functions** for executing business logic.
*   **Database:** A **PostgreSQL** database hosted on Supabase, utilizing **Row-Level Security (RLS)** policies for enforcing fine-grained access control.
*   **Authentication:** **Supabase Auth** with **JWT-based authentication** and **RLS-based access control** ensures secure, role-based access for different user types.
*   **File Storage:** Invoice documents and other relevant files are stored securely in **Supabase Storage**, with access control policies in place.
*   **API & Business Logic:** **Supabase Edge Functions** handle server-side processing, reducing frontend complexity while keeping API requests efficient.
*   **Notifications:** Email notifications are managed using **Supabase Functions** integrated with third-party email providers (e.g., Resend, SendGrid, or SMTP).

  

**Tech Stack Overview**

*   **Frontend:** React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
*   **Hosting:** Vercel (serverless deployment)
*   **Backend:** Supabase Edge Functions (serverless logic)
*   **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL with RLS)
*   **Authentication:** Supabase Auth (JWT + RLS-based access control)
*   **Storage:** Supabase Storage (for invoice documents)
*   **Notifications:** Email service (Resend, SendGrid, or SMTP)
*   **Security:** SSL/TLS encryption, RBAC, RLS, JWT authentication

  

**Benefits of Serverless Architecture**

*   **Scalability**: Automatically scales based on demand, ensuring optimal performance.
*   **Cost-Efficiency**: Pay-as-you-go model eliminates the need for maintaining dedicated servers.
*   **Security**: Built-in authentication, RLS, and Supabaseâ€™s managed infrastructure ensure data security.
*   **Rapid Development**: Eliminates backend setup overhead, enabling faster development cycles.

  

### **Invoice Workflow**

1. The **PMO** creates a new invoice
2. The **PM** and **Provider** receive a notification
3. The **Provider** uploads the invoice document
4. The **PMO**, **PM**, and **FM** receive a notification
5. The **FM** validates the invoice after payment is completed
6. The **Provider** receives a notification confirming the invoice status
